# Census-data-EDA-in-R
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on a modified snapshot of data collected during a household census conducted in England in 2021 to derive insights about socio-economic conditions of the data subjects based on gender, income, level of education, ethnicity, marital status, and housing conditions.

Data transformation was performed on the dataset because it did not follow the three interrelated rules of a tidy data as prescribed by Hadley Wickham (https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)

This repository contains the raw dataset (.csv), an R script (.R) with several applications of ggplot charts and data science techniques in drawing insights about the socio-economic conditions of demographics in England, a Quarto markdown document (.qmd) used to generate a report, the html and pdf report generated, and a powerpoint presentation (.pptx) of insights generated.
